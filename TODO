1. Separate spec definition and graph initialization.
2. Merge tex/cdg visualization from execution (probably just remove tex/cdg visualization).
3. Implement higher-order ODE.
4. Add sympy generation and use it to replace the current compilation.
5. Port the old spice generation to the new implementation.
6. Better I/O interface for cdg
7. Update README and containerize the application
